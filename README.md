# BondCalculator
A US Savings Bond Current Value calculator written in Python.
Written in collaboration with Matt Schilling to fulfil a requirement for a course in Python Programming.
The calculator takes US Savings Bond data from an Excel workbook and uses the Selenium webdriver to post the data to a calculator maintained by the US Department of the Treasury at: https://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice
Current values of the savings bonds are written to an output Excel workbook and the bond portfolio's total value is printed to an entry field on the bond calculator GUI.
